This directory provides several demonstrations of using rtchemstats to compute
the static and dynamic correlation functions of chemical systems. Simulation
configurations to demonstrate these computations are generated by the
[PyLJFluid Python library](https://github.com/matthagy/PyLJFluid).
Additionally, plotting of the correlation functions is performed with the
[matplotlib library](http://matplotlib.org).
